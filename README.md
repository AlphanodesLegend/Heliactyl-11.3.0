We cannot force you to keep the "Powered by Heliactyl" in the footer, but please consider keeping it. It helps getting more visibility to the project and so getting better. We won't do technical support for installations without the notice in the footer.


# Install Guide (pt. 1)

Warning: You need Pterodactyl already set up on a domain for Heliactyl to work
1. Upload the file above onto a Pterodactyl NodeJS server [Download the egg from Parkervcp's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/bots/discord/discord.js)
2. Unarchive the file and set the server to use NodeJS 12
3. Configure settings.json (specifically panel domain/apikey and discord auth settings for it to work)
4. Start the server (Ignore the 2 strange errors that might come up)

# Install Guide (pt. 2)

1. Login to your DNS manager, point the domain you want your dashboard to be hosted on to your VPS IP address. (Example: dashboard.domain.com 192.168.0.1)
2. Run `apt install nginx && apt install certbot` on the vps
3. Run `ufw allow 80` and `ufw allow 443` on the vps
4. Run `certbot certonly -d <Your Heliactyl Domain>` then do 1 and put your email
5. Run `nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/heliactyl.conf`
6. Paste the configuration at the bottom of this and replace with the IP of the pterodactyl server including the port and with the domain you want your dashboard to be hosted on.
